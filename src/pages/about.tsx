                Hello! Thanks for scrolling this far! ðŸ¤— Just a heads up,
                my portfolio is a little outdated at the moment.
                I havenâ€™t had time to update it, but Iâ€™m keeping it up for now,
                and I hope it gives you some inspiration!
                Other than coding, I spend most of my free time playing Animal
                Crossing (add me!) or any other video games.
                ðŸ¤“ I've also been trying to read more so feel free to reach out
                to me with any book recommendations!
